This code demonstrates the use of zero-shot learning with the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model for image classification.
Unlike traditional image recognition models, which require extensive training on labeled datasets to recognize specific classes, CLIP is designed to perform zero-shot classification.
It can understand and classify images based on natural language descriptions without needing any additional training for new categories. 
The model processes both images and text together, allowing it to match images with textual descriptions and identify objects based on general labels provided at runtime.
This flexibility eliminates the need for retraining when encountering new classes, making CLIP highly adaptable to varied tasks. 
In practice, the code loads a pre-trained CLIP model, applies it to a given image, and evaluates how well it aligns with predefined textual labels. 
It outputs probabilities for each label, visualizes the image with the most probable label, and performs a basic error analysis to highlight less confident predictions.
This approach contrasts with conventional image recognition, which typically requires specific training for each new category.
